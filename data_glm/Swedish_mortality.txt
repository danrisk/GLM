The Human Mortality Database (2007) provides mortality data for countries
across periods of time. Recorded are the number of live births,
deaths, and population at risk classified according to age and sex.
From these are calculated such quantities as death rates and
expectations of life. This text uses data for Sweden from 1951
through to 2005.
